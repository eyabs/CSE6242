    Tableau: Highly useful.
    D3: Highly useful.
4.Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets
    R: Somewhat scalable.
    Tableau: Somewhat more scalable than R and D3.
    D3: Somewhat scalable.
5.System requirements to run the visualization (for end users)
    R: Very low, mostly uses static visualizaitons.

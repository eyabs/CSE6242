In my graph, I chose to highlight the movies (nodes) with the highest degree, i.e number of similar movies reference by or referenced from, with a larger size. The movies with the largest degrees were shown with a label of thier id number. The colors of the nodes represent their cluster assignment. I used the Force Atlas algorithm to position nodes within the samecluster assignment somewhat nearby to eachother. The edges in the graph were left with equal thickness, since all the similarity links were of the same weight.
